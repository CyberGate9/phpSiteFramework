  <title>Welcome to SiteFramework!</title>
  <para>This is the SiteFramework (SF) technical documentation.</para>
  <para>This document is intended for anyone who wants to customise a SF installation by using the functions supplied by SF in headers and footers etc.</para>
  <para>My suggestion is you start with the the SiteFramework overview documentation and just use this documentation as reference when you can't work something out in the example templates etc.</para>
